22409,"Before answering your questions, download the latest versions of the PowerPoint slides on Canvas. The latest slides will be posted shortly after class. To facilitate anonymous grading, do not include your name anywhere in the file or the filename. There is a strict upper limit of 2,000 words for your two answers combined, including footnotes (and any bibliographic references). Make sure you do not exceed the word limit. The word count you type into the file should be the word count provided by the Word software, which includes any footnotes. As indicated, this must not exceed 2040 words. (The 40 extra words are so what's already typed into the file doesn't count against your 2,000 word maximum for your two answers combined.) Your answers may be of unequal length, so long as the combined total doesn't exceed 2,000 words. Make sure, however, that each answer is long enough to adequately address the question. Irrespective of length, each answer will be weighted equally in the determination of your grade for this assignment. Whenever you quote from assigned readings, you should include the page or section number in parentheses after the quote: e.g. ""(301)"" or ""(¬ß135)"". There is no need to provide a full citation of any of the assigned readings. If you quote from two different assigned readings by the same author, you should include the date as well as the page number: e.g., ""(1974: 231)"". There is no need to draw on readings beyond the assigned readings. You may, however, do so, in which case provide a full citation of the reading in a footnote. Especially if you draw on readings beyond the assigned readings, make sure to adhere to the next bullet point. Your answers must build upon our examination and discussion in class and the Powerpoint slides rather than being disconnected from these. They should also draw on and critically engage with relevant assigned reading. So long as you adhere to the above bullet point, original insight in your critical engagement is very welcome. Originality in your answers is not, however, necessary for a high grade. It is sufficient to display that you clearly understand and are fully in command of the relevant arguments and the material. You will, however, need to display an understanding and engagement that rises above a mere parroting of points in slides or readings to achieve a high grade. Especially given the short word length, focussed answers that allow you to engage with sufficient critical depth are encouraged. So long as you answer the question, you should not feel the need to cover all points in the readings or slides that might be relevant to the question. Rather, an ability to zero in on key and more significant points will be rewarded. The more sustained development of fewer key points or lines of argument (perhaps even just a single one) will be rewarded over more superficial engagement with more points. Once you have completed your two answers, submit the file (which includes your RUID number at the end of the filename) online by clicking 'Start Assignment' above and then uploading your file via the portal which will display below.

Now is the time to put them all together and make your conlang come even more alive! The main components of the final paper are described below. You can also find the details available in the rubric at the bottom of this page.  1. The name of your conlang:  Please be sure to provide the name of your conlang as a word in the conlang itself. (This is similar to what you had done in your unit 3 assignment.) As always, please also be sure to write your conlang's name in IPA symbols. (You are of course also welcome to provide your conlang's name in the English alphabet, if you'd like, on top of providing the name in IPA transcriptions.) 2. Cultural background, motivation, and purpose:  Please provide a brief introduction to the speakers of your conlang, similar to what you had done in your unit 2 assignment. If you are inventing a conlang for a fantasy setting (such as Klingon), please provide some relevant background information about your speakers: for example, what kind of beings are your speakers? What is their culture like? Is there any information related to how they speak or communicate that would be relevant to the design of your conlang that's worth mentioning? If you are inventing a human language (such as Esperanto), please specify what the purpose of your conlang is: for example, is your conlang invented to facilitate clearer communications? Is your conlang invented to be easy to learn? And so on. A good thing to keep in mind is that it will be helpful for you to focus on the information that is the most relevant to the *linguistic* features of your conlang. Doing so will help you justify why you have designed your conlang in the way that you have. :) 3. Descriptions of linguistic features:  Please provide a detailed description of the various aspects of your conlang's linguistic designs. In other words, please provide a description of your conlang's phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax. (You do not have to talk about your conlang's semantics.) This is the same as what you had done in your unit 3, 4, 5, and 6 assignments. Similar to what you had done for your unit 4 assignment, please submit the sound inventory of your conlang as a separate document. You can use the template hereOpen this document with ReadSpeaker docReader (this is the same template you were given in unit 4). It will also be a good idea to focus on descriptions that you believe are relevant to the motivation or purpose of your conlang. (You have all done this very well in your assignments! :)) Please be sure to use linguistic terminologies in your descriptions where relevant. Please also be sure to provide relevant examples (in IPA) from your conlang to illustrate the various linguistic features of your conlang. For descriptions pertaining to the syntactic aspects of your conlang, please provide your examples (such as example sentences and questions from your conlang) in linguistic glosses.

29861,"Throughout this course, we've examined various variables in online language, and explored how they impact the message being sent. For example, what is the difference between a message spelled in ALL CAPS and one that uses standard capitalization? For your final project, you'll take this a step further. Instead of comparing two posts, one with and one without a given variable, you will analyze variants of a CMC variable in a set of posts from an online speech community, with the goal of determining why an account/user sometimes uses one variant and sometimes another.  Step 1: Select the CMC variable that you will analyze.   Your choices for CMC variables are (i.e. you must choose one of the below): Abbreviations All Caps Emoji* Expressive Lengthening *please note that while this is a popular choice, it isn't any easier than any of the other variables.  Step 2: Identify the variants of the variable that you will examine.  Examples of variants are: For abbreviations: captions that use abbreviations vs. spelled out words (this could be comparing wya to where are you/where you at or comparing rn to right now -- you must compare abbreviations of a word/phrase to fully spelled out words/phrases with similar meanings) For all caps: captions that contain words or phrases written in ALL CAPS vs. those that are written in Standard capitalization For emoji: captions that contain emoji vs. those that do not For expressive lengthening: captions that contain words with extra letters for effect like yesss or yayyy vs. captions that have words with standard spelling Step 3: On the same platform, find  10 posts by the same person/account that contain one variant of your variable in the original caption (not in a retweet/repost/tagged post) 10 posts that contain the other variant Example: You will find 10 posts by Taylor Swift that contain ALL CAPS and 10 posts by Taylor Swift that do not have words in all caps. (You want actual posts by the account, not replies to comments or the comments themselves, and not posts that have been made with other accounts, since you don't know which account was responsible for those captions.)

Here's roughly how your paper should be structured, depending on whether you're arguing in favor of the paper or against it.  Arguing For: Suppose you're arguing for one of the three papers; say, for instance, Frank Jackson's ""Epiphenomenal Qualia"". Your job is then the following: first, briefly state and explain the argument of the paper your writing about (continuing with our example, this means briefly stating and explaining Frank Jackson's argument in his article); second, state and explain what you take to be the best objection to that argument (again, continuing with our example, this means stating and explaining what you imagine to be the best possible objection to Jackson's argument); and finally, respond to that objection, making sure you thoroughly explain why that objection fails (in our example, this means explaining why the objection to Jackson's argument you've just considered doesn't succeed in knocking down his argument).  Arguing Against: Suppose you're arguing against one of the three papers; say, for instance, Frank Jackson's ""Epiphenomenal Qualia"". Your job is then the following: first, briefly state and explain the argument of the paper your writing about (continuing with our example, this means briefly stating and explaining Frank Jackson's argument in his article); second, present and thoroughly explain what you take to be the best objection to that argument  (again, continuing with our example, this means stating and explaining what you imagine to be the best possible objection to Jackson's argument); third, briefly explain how the author (in our example, Jackson) might respond to this objection, and finally, explain why this response fails.  Whichever of the two options you choose, a few criteria should be met:  Your paper should be of the required length (5-7 pages double-spaced, 12-point standard font); Your paper should clearly exemplify the structure I've described above (in fact, keeping to this structure should help you to write your paper, especially if you do not often write papers!) You should double-check (or better, triple-check!) your spelling and grammar; although this isn't a writing class, spelling and grammar matter! Write in complete sentences, check your use of punctuation, and if you're not certain on a word's spelling, look it up! Do your best!

8700,"In recent years, there have been growing calls to ban the use of facial recognition in the U.S., due to ongoing concerns about discrimination, privacy, and civil liberties. Some states (e.g., Maine Links to an external site. ) and cities (e.g., San Francisco Links to an external site. ) have banned the use of facial recognition by law enforcement and government agencies except in select circumstances, while other localities have considered but not implemented such bans. In this case study, your assignment is to use concepts and materials from class and your own research to 1) describe the basic contours of the debate about whether law enforcement should be banned from using facial recognition algorithms, and 2) take an informed position on the debate. While facial recognition is increasingly used by private companies as well as government agencies (and Congressional legislation has been proposed to curb private use), this case study asks you to specifically focus on the use of facial recognition by law enforcement and other government agencies. Step 1: Do some research about bans on facial recognition and the arguments for and against them. Focus your research on two areas: * Find at least two reputable media articles with more information about proposed and/or implemented facial recognition bans.¬† * Find at least two scholarly sources that address the issues at stake. For example, relevant scholarly sources could be academic articles that explain how facial recognition technology works, describe some of the issues that have arisen (e.g., mismatches leading to erroneous arrests, disparate levels of accuracy for people of different races, ethnic groups, and genders, etc), and/or theorize the broader ethical issues raised by facial recognition, including discriminatory impacts, government surveillance, civil liberties, and privacy.¬† Step 2: Drawing on the sources you find AND material from class, write a short essay that reflects on facial recognition from a policy perspective. Your memo should be 800-1000 words (not including references). Make sure to cite all your sources! Your essay must contain the following components: 1. Begin with a brief (i.e., 1-2 paragraphs) description of facial recognition technology and the controversy around the use of facial recognition by law enforcement. Be sure to answer the following questions: [2 points (.5*4)]     * In broad strokes (you do not have to get extremely technical), describe how facial recognition algorithms work.

8470,"Slavery in the beginning was solely dependent on race. The beginning of slavery was merely a way to classify people into being servants or being normal citizens. For example, according to Morgan‚Äôs American Slavery, the children of slaves were technically free members of society.  They were allowed to leave the plantation or even just be raised by slaves, but they were technically not slaves but people in society. However, when compared to modern day slavery, the children of slaves were technically born into slavery and served the same family. Specifically, there were laws that were created that ‚Äúdeclared that children should be slave or free according to the condition of the mother‚Äù(1). This law had multiple benefits. For example, it allowed slave masters to impregnate female slaves, leading to the creation of more slaves for the master without the slave master being there for child support. Another benefit this law had to slave masters is that it allowed masters to have an increasing and prolonged number of slaves throughout their life. This created a loop where slave masters would procreate to gain profit and gain more slaves. Even if the slave trade had stopped, ‚Äúthe class of free negroes was‚Ä¶ already in existence and could not be eliminated‚Äù(2). There were also many economic factors that contributed to the development of modern day slavery. One of these factors was the need for cheap labor for labor-intensive projects and produce. These products were known as cash crops like tobacco, indigo, and cotton. These crops were labor-intensive, and there was a constant demand for a cheap and controllable labor force. Going off this, there was intense profitability within slavery. Slavery proved to be an economically efficient system for the produce economy. Slaves could be purchased at a one-time purchase rate and they were forced to work without wages. The original form of slavery had children possess the ability to become free and allowed for slaves to buy freedom for themselves. However, later forms of slavery had children who were born into slavery forced to become slaves as well. Moreover, the government created laws to trap as many black people in the plantations which in turn would indirectly eliminate free black people and keep them contained within the slave community.",AI-generated,Other,A,Human,11,May Have AI,80,5,0

When even the countries these immigrants come from are experiencing birth rate collapse, this measure can be said to have reached the end of its useful life and something else must be done.

Male seniors for the same years were 76% and 74%, respectively.

A politician is nearly always a careerist. This has resulted, among other reasons as to why, in what feels to many people as a political class that listens most intently and enacts laws which benefit their wealthy patrons first and foremost without consideration given to people who do not run in DC circles, i.e. the common man. It might be argued the way to counteract this is to begin electing people we do not imagine to fit the bill of a 'serious politician' because anyone who has that perfectly manicured background will only be more of the same.

Could these outcomes instead be justified on grounds that they are the upshot of gambles it would be rational for the parties in the original position to take on behalf of the people they represent from behind the veil?  Your answers must build upon our examination and discussion in class and the Powerpoint slides rather than being disconnected from these. They should also draw on and critically engage with relevant assigned reading. The exam is due by 11:59 pm on Monday May 12. Late submissions will not be graded in the absence of a valid excuse. Use of AI such as ChatGPT is not permitted in any stages of the writing process. See these feedback slides on your first take-home exam. Before answering your questions, also download the latest versions of the PowerPoint slides on Canvas. The latest slides will be posted shortly after class. To facilitate anonymous grading, do not include your name anywhere in the file or the filename. There is a strict upper limit of 2,000 words for your two answers combined, including footnotes (and any bibliographic references). Make sure you do not exceed the word limit. The word count you type into the file should be the word count provided by the Word software, which includes any footnotes. As indicated, this must not exceed 2040 words. (The 40 extra words are so what's already typed into the file doesn't count against your 2,000 word maximum for your two answers combined.) Although there is no formal lower word limit, your answer will be strengthened if you make full and non-repetitive use of your overall word limit. Answers that fall significantly short of the word limit generally tend to be much less impressive than those that make much fuller use of the word limit. Your answers may be of unequal length, so long as the combined total doesn't exceed 2,000 words. Make sure, however, that each answer is long enough to adequately address the question. Irrespective of length, each answer will be weighted equally in the determination of your grade for this assignment. Whenever you quote from assigned readings, you should include the page or section number in parentheses after the quote: e.g. ""(301)"" or ""(¬ß28.1)"". There is no need to provide a full citation of any of the assigned readings. If you quote from two different assigned readings by the same author, you should include the date as well as the page number: e.g., ""(1974: 231)"". There is no need to draw on readings beyond the assigned readings. You may, however, do so, in which case provide a full citation of the reading in a footnote. Especially if you draw on readings beyond the assigned readings, make sure to adhere to the next bullet point which I stated above, but which I repeat here for emphasis: Your answers must build upon our examination and discussion in class and the Powerpoint slides rather than being disconnected from these. They should also draw on and critically engage with relevant assigned reading. So long as you adhere to the above bullet point, original insight in your critical engagement is very welcome. Originality in your answers is not, however, necessary for a high grade. It is sufficient to display that you clearly understand and are fully in command of the relevant arguments and the material. You will, however, need to display an understanding and engagement that rises above a mere parroting of points in slides or readings to achieve a high grade. Especially given the short word length, focussed answers that allow you to engage with sufficient critical depth are encouraged. So long as you answer the question, you should not feel the need to cover all points in the readings or slides that might be relevant to the question. Rather, an ability to zero in on key and more significant points will be rewarded. The more sustained development of fewer key points or lines of argument (perhaps even just a single one) will be rewarded over more superficial engagement with more points.

26243,"make this in an essay format to submit: In recent years, there have been growing calls to ban the use of facial recognition in the U.S., due to ongoing concerns about discrimination, privacy, and civil liberties. Some states (e.g., Maine Links to an external site.) and cities (e.g., San Francisco Links to an external site.) have banned the use of facial recognition by law enforcement and government agencies except in select circumstances, while other localities have considered but not implemented such bans.  In this case study, your assignment is to use concepts and materials from class and your own research to 1) describe the basic contours of the debate about whether law enforcement should be banned from using facial recognition algorithms, and 2) take an informed position on the debate. While facial recognition is increasingly used by private companies as well as government agencies (and Congressional legislation has been proposed to curb private use), this case study asks you to specifically focus on the use of facial recognition by law enforcement and other government agencies.  Step 1: Do some research about bans on facial recognition and the arguments for and against them. Focus your research on two areas:  Find at least two reputable media articles with more information about proposed and/or implemented facial recognition bans.  Find at least two scholarly sources that address the issues at stake. For example, relevant scholarly sources could be academic articles that explain how facial recognition technology works, describe some of the issues that have arisen (e.g., mismatches leading to erroneous arrests, disparate levels of accuracy for people of different races, ethnic groups, and genders, etc), and/or theorize the broader ethical issues raised by facial recognition, including discriminatory impacts, government surveillance, civil liberties, and privacy.  Step 2: Drawing on the sources you find AND material from class, write a short essay that reflects on facial recognition from a policy perspective.  Your memo should be 800-1000 words (not including references). Make sure to cite all your sources!  Your essay must contain the following components:  Begin with a brief (i.e., 1-2 paragraphs) description of facial recognition technology and the controversy around the use of facial recognition by law enforcement. Be sure to answer the following questions: [2 points (.5*4)] In broad strokes (you do not have to get extremely technical), describe how facial recognition algorithms work. [.5 points] In cities and states where law enforcement agencies are using facial recognition, how are they doing so? For what purposes? [.5 points] In cities and states that have banned the use of facial recognition algorithms by law enforcement, what are some of their stated reasons for doing so? [.5 points] In cities and states that have banned the use of facial recognition by law enforcement with some exceptions, what are the exceptions (i.e., the circumstances in which law enforcement is permitted to use facial recognition)? [.5 points] Once you have described the debate around facial recognition, the remainder of your essay should take a position for or against banning the use facial recognition systems by law enforcement. Your position must be an informed one: that is, you are not simply stating your opinion, but making a persuasive argument in favor of your position that is supported by evidence and concepts from class and from your own research. If you take a position that is somewhere in between for and against (e.g., ‚Äúlaw enforcement should be prohibited from using facial recognition algorithms except in XYZ circumstances,‚Äù or ‚Äúlaw enforcement should only be permitted to use facial recognition algorithms that meet XYZ fairness and accuracy criteria‚Äù), make sure you spell out what the special circumstances or particular criteria you are advocating for, and why.
